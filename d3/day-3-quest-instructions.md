# Day 3: Refining Functions & Coding Best Practices

## Introduction

Welcome to Day 3! Today, refine your functions, boost game dynamics to make it more interactive. On the research front learn about best coding practices, and focus on clean, readable, well-documented code.

## Daily Overview & Schedule

### Part 1: Collaborative Development & Research Hour (pairs) | 14:00 - 15:00

Swap roles and dive into refining your game and conducting research.

**Dev Team:**

- Further refine functions and flow control.
- Enhance game complexity and interactivity.
- Test new features to ensure smooth game experience.

**Research Team:**

- Read lesson in student portal: **Coding best practices**
- Study best coding practices for clean, maintainable code.
- Learn about proper function and module documentation.

### Part 2: Interactive Knowledge Exchange (full group) | 15:00 - 15:30

Once again, it's time to share your findings and progress with the rest of the team.

**Dev Team:**

- Share your progress on refining the game's functions and enhancing its interactivity.
- Discuss any new features added and the challenges faced during this process.

**Research Team:**

- Share your research findings on good coding practices and documentation techniques.
- Discuss how these practices can be applied to the game development.

### Part 3: Application & Testing Phase (full group) | 15:30 - 16:30

In the final part of the day, you'll apply your newfound knowledge to the game and test any modifications you've made.

**Research Team:**

- Apply the best coding practices and documentation techniques learned to the game code.
- Refactor and document the code where necessary.

**Dev Team:**

- Test the changes made by the Research team to ensure they meet the expected standards.
- Support and challenge the Research team during this process, ensuring the game code remains clean, efficient, and well-documented.

Remember to communicate with your team members, make frequent saves, and refresh your work on Google Colab to ensure everyone is updated. Have a productive Day 3!
